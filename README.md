1. Clone the VIPERTemplates repository
1. Run the install script (double click)

# VIPER
VIPER is a 6 tier architecture that abstracts module tasks into each tier such that everything has a single responsibility. Its conforms to SOLID design principles and is an implementation of Clean Architecture concepts.

Head over to the [VIPERTemplates Wiki](https://github.com/ColdLogical/VIPERTemplates/wiki) for some in-depth information on VIPER and using these templates.

# Updating
1. Pull the repository changes
  - `git pull`
    - Since we created a symbolic link above, updating the repository changes the templates in xcode without needing to do any other steps.

*Note: When Xcode updates, it replaces the template folder. All you need to do is run the install script again, and the templates will be available.*

# TODO

- Keep it sexy
